#Simple_Oscillator

A digital synthesizer built in C++ using the JUICE framework for learning audio programming concepts.

## Current Features (In Development)
- [Planning] Basic oscillator implementation
- [Planning] Waveform generation (sine, square, saw, triangle)

## Roadmap
- Implement basic oscillator
- Add waveform types
- Create envelope generator (ADSR)
- Add basic filtering
- Implement effects

## Technologies
- C++
- JUICE


## Learning Resources
- The Audio Programming Book
- [Other resources you're using]

## Build Instructions
[You can add these later as you develop the project]
